# godaddy_clone

This project aims to replicate the intuitive and sleek user interface of GoDaddy's website, which simplifies website management tasks. Inspired by features like the scrollable template section and testimonial section, I embarked on creating a clone. While I couldn't fully grasp the intricacies of the scrollable section, the project was an enjoyable learning experience.
